5. Only infertile flowers used to be able to be used to craft dyed [blocks](https://robloxislands.fandom.com/wiki/Block).

6. The [elephant banner](https://robloxislands.fandom.com/wiki/Elephant_Banner) and the [lunar banner](https://robloxislands.fandom.com/wiki/Lunar_Banner) are the only items that can be crafted using mundane flowers.Although unobtainable, fertile mundane flowers show up in the crafting recipe for the two banners.

17. Other than mundane, the most common flower color is red.  Chrome is the least common color. 
18. If you try to breed a lavender combination that doesn't work (e.g. fertile purple+fertile purple)it doesn't give you a mundane flower,but it does make it dry after a few minutes. therefore,making lavenders the only flower that doesn't have a mundane version.
